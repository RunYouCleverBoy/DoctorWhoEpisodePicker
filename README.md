This project is there for educational reasons. It is an exercise for teaching HTML/JS fundaments in a fun way.
Also, when teaching youngsters of how to code, it is most important to emphasize the value of order. That is, using source control, to begin with.
The roadmap should include tags and branches for every stage of learning.
